* ### Design

**Five Planes of UX**\
For this gym website, I followed a structured design process called the "Five Planes of UX" to make sure the site works for both the business and its users. Here's how I approached each stage:
1. Strategy Plane
   * Gym Needs:
      * Attract 20% more members in the next 6 months
      * Keep current members happy and engaged
      * Create a professional but welcoming brand image
      * Get quality leads through the website
      * Reduce staff time answering basic phone calls by 30%

   * Users Need:
      * Current Members: Easy access to schedules, updates, and community features
      * Potential Members: See what the gym offers, clear pricing, and simple signup
      * Visitors: Quick access to contact info, FAQs, and directions

   * How We'll Measure Success:
      * How many visitors actually inquire or sign up
      * How long people spend on the site and if they book classes
      * Fewer administrative calls to the gym
      * Growth in social media and positive member feedback

2. Scope Plane
   * Website Features:
      * Works on all devices (phones, tablets, computers)
      * Class schedule you can sort and filter
      * Forms to sign up or ask questions
      * Photo gallery of the gym and Google Maps integration
      * Social media links and contact forms

   * Content Needed:
      * Quality photos of the gym and classes
      * Member success stories
      * Clear descriptions of classes, schedules, and prices
      * Staff profiles and an FAQ section
      * Clear directions to the gym

3. Structure Plane
   * Site Organization:
      * Main navigation: Home, About, Membership, Classes, Facilities, Success Stories, Contact
      * Important information never more than 1-2 clicks away
      * Related content connected and revealed as needed

   * User Interaction:
      * Different pathways for new and current members
      * Strategic placement of "join now" and other action buttons
      * Consistent navigation and interactive elements
      * Forms that validate information and confirm submissions

4. Skeleton Plane
   * Interface Layout:
      * Clean design with clear content hierarchy
      * Sticky header that stays visible as you scroll
      * Footer with quick links and contact details
      * Card-based design for classes and memberships
      * Responsive layouts with breathing room

   * Navigation Design:
      * Main navigation in header (switches to hamburger menu on phones)
      * Secondary navigation for subtopics
      * Search feature for finding specific information quickly

   * Information Presentation:
      * Visual cues to show how content relates
      * Consistent use of icons and highlighting
      * Calendar-style view for schedules
      * Maps and progress tracking visuals

5. Surface Plane
   * Visual Elements:
      * Colors: Dark tech-inspired theme with blue accents and highlights
      * Typography: Clean, modern fonts that suggest both fitness and technology
      * Images: Real, diverse photos of gym members and facilities
      * Interactive Elements: Distinctive buttons, hover effects, subtle animations
      * Layout: Consistent grid system, designed for mobile first

While I planned everything above, some things changed during development to improve the user experience. The final design maintains the tech/coding aesthetic while keeping everything user-friendly and accessible.

**Colors**\
I chose a dark theme for the site to create a bold, powerful feeling that matches the gym environment while also giving it that "tech" aesthetic. The main colors are:
   * Dark backgrounds (#222, #333) reminiscent of code editors and futuristic interfaces
   * Bright blue accents (#5599cc) that evoke technology and digital elements
   * Red (#cc4455) for attention-grabbing elements like promotional badges
   * Different shades of light text (white, light gray) to create visual hierarchy and mimic terminal-style interfaces

**Typography**\
I kept the typography simple and readable using Roboto from Google Fonts, which has a clean, slightly technical feel. Bold headings (700 weight) stand out against regular text (400 weight) to guide users through the content.

**Layout**
   * I used Bootstrap's grid system to make the site fully responsive
   * Content is organized in clear sections with consistent spacing
   * Card-based designs for membership plans and team profiles make information easy to scan
   * Left borders with the highlight blue color create a distinctive visual style throughout the site

**Components**
   * Custom buttons in the brand blue color with a tech-inspired look
   * Dark form inputs with light text reminiscent of coding terminals
   * Class schedule table with alternating backgrounds
   * Colorful social media icons in their brand colors

**Mobile Experience**\
I made sure the site works well on all devices by:
   * Adjusting spacing and sizing for smaller screens
   * Creating a collapsible navigation menu
   * Making the class schedule table scrollable on small screens
   * Ensuring all important content remains accessible and readable

**Special Touches**
   * Hover effects on navigation links
   * Card designs for testimonials and team profiles
   * Image placeholders with rounded corners
   * Google Maps integration on the contact page
   * Homepage carousel to showcase gym facilities

Our design combines fitness with a tech-inspired look, showing that at Fit Stack Gym, we believe in building your health and strength one layer at a time - just like building good technology requires careful, step-by-step progress.
